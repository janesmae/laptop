# dotFiles 2.0

This is the "welcome" screen to my .files including vim, zsh, git, and tmux configurations.

This branch is only for the installer script. Master branch includes all the configs and settings.

Feel free to use it and even make suggestions, however I may decline changes
if there's no value to me.

## Install

(:warning: **DO NOT** run this if you don't fully
understand [what it does](install.sh). Seriously, **DON'T**!)

```sh
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/janesmae/dotfiles/install/install.sh)"
```
